    "text": "A scene from the series. Source: Netflix\nRecently the streaming platform Netflix released the Three-body problem, an eight episodes sci-fi series based on Liu Cixin’s trilogy, the Remembrance of Earth’s Past. The series portrays, jumping from past, present and future, the interaction between the human race and an alien civilization living in a nearby star system . One of the main charachters soon realizes that the foreign culture lives in a three-body star system, where stable eras characterised by development and prosperity are followed by unpredictable chaotic eras where survival is almost impossible. In short, the technologically advanced creatures, tired of seeing their species threatened with extinction, come to the city seeking prosperity in a stable solar system at the expense of human survival. The story is based on a real nearby star system called Alpha Centauri. Located about 4 light-years from Earth, it’s the closest star system to us. It contains three stars: Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, with masses similar to our sun, and a further red dwarf, Proxima Centauri, which has two planets orbiting it.\nThe three-body problem is a classical mechanics example of a chaotic dinamical system that puzzled and fascinated physicists for centuries. The difficulty is to predict with accuracy the dynamical evolution of the constituent bodies through the Newton’s law of universal gravitation. It turns out that the system is chaotic for the majority of conditions, and only a few stable solutions exists. As a result, numerical methods are required to solve the equations of motion. In this post we review the mathematical formulation of the problem, providing a Julia implementation for numerical integration."

    "text": "The three-body problem\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of conic sections by slicing\na cone at different angles. Source: Labster\n\n\n\nAt the end of the seventeenth century the English physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton formulated in his work Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica the law of universal gravitation, thus opening the door to celestial mechanics. Using Newton’s law of motion it is possible to compute exactly the orbits described by two gravitational interacting bodies. The allowed shapes for these orbits are obtained by slicing at different angles the conic sections, as illustrated in Figure 1. As we all know, the Earth describes an elliptic orbit under the Sun gravitational field. Newton’s law works just fine as long as we consider two interacting bodies in a closed system, therefore neglecting interactions with other celestial bodies. However as an additional object is introduced, small changes on the initial positions and velocities of the three bodies give rise to distinct dynamical evoulutions, and the system enter a chaotic phase where orbits do not follow a clear path and become unpredictables in the long term. There is no analytic formula that gives us instant by instant positions and velocities of the three bodies. This is known as the three body problem, a special case of the more general \\(n\\)-body problem. In what follows we stick to \\(n=3\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the \\(n\\)-body problem with \\(n&gt;2\\) is a chaotic system, why do we live in a stable solar system with \\(8\\) planets and several celestial bodies orbiting around our star? The reason is simple: our sun contains roughly \\(99.8\\%\\) of the mass of the solar system! As a result, the gravitational interactions among planets are by far subleading\n\n\n\nMathematical formulation\nBefore jumping to the mathematical formulation of the three body problem, let us review the Newton’s law of universal gravitation: two massive bodies attracts each other with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportianal to the square of their distance. Let’s assume \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) to be the masses of the two bodies, located in space at postion \\(\\mathbf{r}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{r}_2\\), with \\(\\mathbf{r}_i=(x_i, y_i, z_i)\\) being a vector position with three spacial components. Together with Newton’s second law of motion \\(F=ma\\), the equation describing the dynamics of the body \\(m_1\\) under the gravitational influence of \\(m_2\\) thus takes the form\n\\[\nF_1 = m_1\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_1 = -G \\frac{m_1m_2}{(\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r_2})^2}.\n\\] Here \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, while \\(mathbf{\\ddot r}_1\\) is the body acceleration expressed in terms of the second temporal derivative of the position\n\\[\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_1 =  - Gm_3\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\mathbf{r}_3}{|\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\mathbf{r}_3|^3} - Gm_2\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\mathbf{r}_2}{|\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\mathbf{r}_2|^3}\n\\] \\[\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_2 =   - Gm_1\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{2}-\\mathbf{r}_1}{|\\mathbf{r}_{2}-\\mathbf{r}_1|^3} - Gm_3\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{2}-\\mathbf{r}_3}{|\\mathbf{r}_{2}-\\mathbf{r}_3|^3}\n\\] \\[\n\\mathbf{\\ddot r}_3 =   - Gm_2\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{3}-\\mathbf{r}_1}{|\\mathbf{r}_{3}-\\mathbf{r}_1|^3} -Gm_1\\frac{\\mathbf{r}_{3}-\\mathbf{r}_1}{|\\mathbf{r}_{3}-\\mathbf{r}_1|^3}\n\\]\nOur goal is to determine the positions and velocieties of the three bodies at some time \\(t\\) by solving numerically the above equations, given some initial conditions \\(\\mathbf{r}_i(t_0), \\ \\mathbf{\\dot r}_i(t_0)\\) at \\(t_0=0\\)\n\n\nhey"

My research is focused on the non-perturbative aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), a theory describing the strong interaction in fundamental particle physics. My work is performed with lattice field theory techniques to tackle the non-perturbative phenomena of QCD. In Lattice QCD the continuum space-time is discretized onto a grid-like structure, allowing to perform numerical simulations in large-scale computational facilities to solve the QCD equations. This approach is particularly useful for understanding phenomena at low energies, where perturbative methods may not be as effective.\nA list of main topics includes:"

    "text": "In a somewhat forgotten paper [1] it was shown how to perform interpolations between relativistic and static computations in order to obtain results for heavy-light observables for masses from, say, \\(m_{\\mathrm{charm}}\\) to \\(m_{\\mathrm{bottom}}\\). All quantities are first continuum extrapolated and then interpolated in \\(1/m_h = 1 / m_{\\mathrm{heavy}}\\). Large volume computations are combined with finite volume ones where a relativistic bottom quark is accessible with small \\(am_{\\mathrm{bottom}}\\). We discuss how this strategy is extended to semi-leptonic form factors and other quantities of phenomenological interest. The essential point is to form quantities where the limit \\(m_h\\to \\infty\\) is approached with power corrections \\(O(1/m_h)\\) only. Perturbative corrections \\(\\sim \\alpha_s(m_h)^{\\gamma + n }\\) are cancelled in the construction of the observables. We also point out how such an approach can help to control systematics in semi-leptonic decays with just large volume data. First numerical results with \\(N_f=2+1\\) and lattice spacings down to 0.039 fm are presented in [2].\nFull paper: please download the available versions here."

My research is focused on the non-perturbative aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), a theory describing the strong interaction in fundamental particle physics. My work is performed with lattice field theory techniques to tackle the non-perturbative phenomena of QCD. In Lattice QCD the continuum space-time is discretized onto a grid-like structure, allowing to perform numerical simulations in large-scale computational facilities to solve the QCD equations. This approach is particularly useful for understanding phenomena at low energies, where perturbative methods may not be as effective.\nA list of main topics includes:"

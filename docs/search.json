    "text": "In a somewhat forgotten paper [1] it was shown how to perform interpolations between relativistic and static computations in order to obtain results for heavy-light observables for masses from, say, \\(m_{\\mathrm{charm}}\\) to \\(m_{\\mathrm{bottom}}\\). All quantities are first continuum extrapolated and then interpolated in \\(1/m_h = 1 / m_{\\mathrm{heavy}}\\). Large volume computations are combined with finite volume ones where a relativistic bottom quark is accessible with small \\(am_{\\mathrm{bottom}}\\). We discuss how this strategy is extended to semi-leptonic form factors and other quantities of phenomenological interest. The essential point is to form quantities where the limit \\(m_h\\to \\infty\\) is approached with power corrections \\(O(1/m_h)\\) only. Perturbative corrections \\(\\sim \\alpha_s(m_h)^{\\gamma + n }\\) are cancelled in the construction of the observables. We also point out how such an approach can help to control systematics in semi-leptonic decays with just large volume data. First numerical results with \\(N_f=2+1\\) and lattice spacings down to 0.039 fm are presented in [2].\nFull paper: please download the available versions here."

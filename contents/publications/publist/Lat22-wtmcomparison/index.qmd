## Abstract

We present two calculations of heavy quark physics, with respectively non-perturbatively improved Wilson and twisted mass Wilson fermions, both on $N_f=2+1$ CLS configurations with open boundary conditions. We evaluate those discretisations through a Ward identity on the three-point functions. We also check the universality of our continuum results. All our results are compatible with an \orderof(a^2) scaling for both actions.

## Abstract

We consider a mixed action approach where valence Wilson twisted mass (Wtm) fermions at maximal twist are combined with CLS ensembles consisting of $N_f=2+1$ flavours of $O(a)$-improved Wilson sea quarks. We present an update of the results of the matching of valence and sea quarks, and of the subsequent continuum-limit scaling studies of light-quark observables. A scale setting procedure combining the results from the $O(a)$-improved Wilson setup to the ones from the valence Wtm regularisation is discussed.
